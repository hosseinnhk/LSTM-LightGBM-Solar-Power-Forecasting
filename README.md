# LSTM-LightGBM-Solar-Power-Forecasting
A day ahead PV output forecasting utilizing boosting recursive multistep LightGBM-LSTM pipeline

This study introduces an open-source framework that employs a merged recursive multistep LightGBM LSTM network to forecast the photovoltaic (PV) output power one day in advance, with a temporal resolution of one hour. The models used in this study were trained using both meteorological and historical data logs from the designated PV farm.
