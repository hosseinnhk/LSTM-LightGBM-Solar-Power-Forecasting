# LSTM-LightGBM-Solar-Power-Forecasting
A day ahead PV output forecasting utilizing boosting recursive multistep LightGBM-LSTM pipeline

This study introduces an open-source framework that employs a merged recursive multistep LightGBM LSTM network to forecast the photovoltaic (PV) output power one day in advance, with a temporal resolution of one hour. The investigation was carried out under weather conditions prevalent in Northern Europe, characterized by greater annual variability in solar radiation. The models used in this study were trained using both meteorological and historical data logs from the designated PV farm. The outcomes indicate that the boosting approach employed in this study outperformed individual models in terms of its predictive power.
